# Sorting-techniques
In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order. The most frequently used orders are numerical order and lexicographical order. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms that require input data to be in sorted lists.

There are many ways to sort a list of numbers or items (be it in ascending order or descending order). Each sorting algorithm has a time and a space complexity. EAch time algorithm has a best, aevrage and worse complexity to it.

A list of complexity and its details are shared as an attachment for study.
